# Hey, my name is Tedy ðŸ‘‹

I am still very very new to the blockchain world and have mostly spent my time designing for various projects of varrying _success_. I'll keep things organized by project for now as that seems to make sense, but we will see how this space evolves as my work in Web3 starts to pile up.

I am really enjoying brand and identity work with projects looking to build trust with a cohesive identity. Packages includes a logo, wordmark, palette, font combo, and starter visual package for social media and Discord branding. Below you can find projects I've provided these services for.

I have the pleasure of handling a lot of the design heavy lifting for Batasm Finance including building out a flexible brand system to spin up new projects along the Pepe meme theme. It's been remarkably rewarding due to the challenge, and team collaboration we have. Building a Bat, Vampire, and Farmer Pepe logo that are all interchangable has been fun, matching to a fresh color palette that can work with the others has led to some of my best color work to date.

Throw in getting to help skin a Tomb fork to ensure users reckognize the familiar Tomb interface, but also understand that it has been fully customized and designed by folks who are trying to provide a better experience â€” build trust.
